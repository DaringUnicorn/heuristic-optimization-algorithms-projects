   • Weaknesses: Struggles with very large graphs
   • Best for: Medium graphs when speed is priority

3. Memetic GA:
   • Strengths: Best color efficiency for small graphs
   • Weaknesses: Very slow on large graphs
   • Best for: Small graphs when color efficiency is priority

4. GA + Greedy + Custom Crossover:
   • Strengths: Balanced performance, reliable

📋 RECOMMENDATIONS:
====================
• Use GA + DSATUR + Tabu Search for graphs with > 100 vertices
• Use Memetic GA for small graphs (< 50 vertices) when color efficiency matters
• Use GA + Adaptive + Repair for medium graphs (50-100 vertices) when speed matters
• Always use dynamic color estimation for graphs with > 50 vertices
• Reduce population size for very large graphs to maintain reasonable runtime

CONCLUSION:
===============
The hybrid genetic algorithms demonstrate excellent performance across different graph sizes.
GA + DSATUR + Tabu Search emerges as the most versatile algorithm, performing well
across all graph sizes while maintaining reasonable runtime.

The project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of combining genetic algorithms
with local search techniques and heuristic initialization for the NP-hard Graph Coloring problem.

Overall success rate of 87.5% across 16 experiments shows the robustness of these hybrid approaches.
